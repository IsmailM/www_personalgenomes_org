<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>
  Members of the Global Network of Personal Genome Projects
  adhere to the following guidelines:
</p>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span6">
    <ul class="li-main">
      <li><strong>(a) Public Data.</strong>
        Participants are invited to publicly share their genomic and
        trait data in an integrated, publicly-accessible format using a
        CC0 waiver or equivalent public domain license.
      </li>
      <li><strong>(b) Non-anonymous.</strong>
        The risks of participant re-identification are addressed up
        front, as an integral part of the consent and enrollment
        process; neither anonymity nor confidentiality of participant
        identities or their data are promised to research participants.
      </li>
      <li><strong>(c) Equal access.</strong>
        Participants are provided access to their individual research
        data in a timely and complete fashion (i.e., raw data and not
        just summary results, where feasible).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <ul class="li-main">
      <li><strong>(d) Oversight.</strong>
        Each member must at all times maintain current Institutional
        Review Board (IRB) approval or local equivalent, and will work
        with PersonalGenomes.org to continue to implement identified
        best practices for responsible public genomics research.
      </li>
      <li><strong>(e) Not for profit.</strong>
        The research project is managed or sponsored by a non-profit
        organization (or local equivalent). In addition, other than
        purposes of reasonable cost recovery, the member shall not sell
        or license participant data or tissues.
      </li>
    </ul>
