    The Personal Genome Project (PGP) is creating a freely available
    scientific resource that brings together genomic, environmental and
    human trait data. These data are donated by volunteers enrolled in a
    PGP study from our global network. Initiated by George Church at
    Harvard Medical School in 2005, the PGP has pioneered ethical, legal,
    and technical aspects related to the creation of public resources
    involving highly identifiable data like human genomes.

<h3>{% trans "Public Data, Methods, and Materials" %}</h3>
<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    We believe sharing is good for science and society. The PGP is
    dedicated to creating public resources that everyone can access.
    Privacy, confidentiality and anonymity are impossible to guarantee
    in a context like the PGP where public sharing of genetic data is an
    explicit goal. Therefore, the PGP collaborates with participants
    willing to waive expectations of privacy. This waiver is not for
    everyone, but the volunteers who join make a valuable and lasting
    contribution to science.

<h3>{% trans "Ongoing Participatory Research" %}</h3>
<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    We love the people behind the data. Our project aims to maintain
    lifelong relationships with participants. We want to collaborate
    on tracking health and other traits as they unfold over the course
    of a participantâ€™s life. We also want to better understand the
    benefits and risks related to accessing and sharing extensive
    genomic and other personal data.
    {% endblocktrans %}

<h3>{% trans "Genomes, Environments, and Traits" %}</h3>
<p>
    {% blocktrans %}
    The genome is just a part of the story: genes interact with
    the environment to form traits. Participants may choose to
    contribute other public data to build public records of their
    health and traits. We also try to connect participants with
    research projects interested in profiling other aspects of human
    experience to produce even more extensive collections of
    associated data.
