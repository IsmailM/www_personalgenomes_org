  {% block about-pgp-site-longname %}Our project{% endblock %} is a
  member of the Personal Genome Project global network.
</p>

<p>
  The Personal Genome Project (PGP) global network is creating
  freely available scientific resources that bring together genomic,
  environmental and human trait data. These data are donated by
  volunteers enrolled in projects in the global network. Initiated
  by George Church at Harvard Medical School in 2005, the Personal
  Genome Project has pioneered ethical, legal, and technical aspects
  related to the creation of public resources involving highly
  identifiable data like human genomes.
</p>

<h4>Public Data, Methods, and Materials</h4>
<p>
  We believe sharing is good for science and society. PGP projects are
  dedicated to creating public resources that everyone can access.
  Privacy, confidentiality and anonymity are impossible to guarantee
  in a context like the PGP where public sharing of genetic data is an
  explicit goal. Therefore, PGP projects collaborate with participants
  willing to waive expectations of privacy. This waiver is not for
  everyone, but the volunteers who join make a valuable and lasting
  contribution to science.
</p>

<h4>Ongoing Participatory Research</h4>
<p>
  We love the people behind the data. Our projects aim to maintain
  lifelong relationships with participants. We want to collaborate
  on tracking health and other traits as they unfold over the course
  of a participantâ€™s life. We also want to better understand the
  benefits and risks related to accessing and sharing extensive
  genomic and other personal data.
</p>

<h4>Genomes, Environments, and Traits</h4>
<p>
  The genome is just a part of the story: genes interact with
  the environment to form traits. Participants may choose to
  contribute other public data to build public records of their
  health and traits. We also try to connect participants with
  research projects interested in profiling other aspects of human
  experience to produce even more extensive collections of
  associated data.
