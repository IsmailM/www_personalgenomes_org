  {{ our_site }} is a member of the Global Network of Personal
  Genome Projects (PGP), a group of research studies creating
  freely available scientific resources that bring together
  genomic, environmental and human trait data donated by
  volunteers. Initiated by George Church at Harvard Medical
  School in 2005, the Personal Genome Project has pioneered
  ethical, legal, and technical aspects related to the creation
  of public resources involving highly identifiable data like
  human genomes.

<h4>{% trans "Public Data, Methods, and Materials" %}</h4>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  We believe sharing is good for science and society. Our project is
  dedicated to creating public resources that everyone can access.
  Privacy, confidentiality and anonymity are impossible to guarantee
  in a context like this research study where public sharing of
  genetic data is an explicit goal. Therefore, our project
  collaborates with participants who are fully aware of the
  implications and privacy concerns of making their data public.
  Volunteering is not for everyone, but the participants
  who join make a valuable and lasting contribution to science.

<h4>{% trans "Ongoing Participatory Research" %}</h4>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  We respect the people behind the data, and we aim to maintain
  strong relationships with participants. We want to collaborate
  on tracking health and other traits as they unfold over time.
  We also want to better understand the
  benefits and risks related to accessing and sharing personal
  genomes and other types of data.

<h4>{% trans "Genomes, Environments, and Traits" %}</h4>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  The genome is just a part of the story: genes interact with
  the environment to form traits. Participants may choose to
  contribute other public data to build public records of their
  health and traits. We also try to connect participants with
  research, education, and citizen science projects that
  are connected to personal genome data.
