<p class="lead">
  In an unprecedented achievement, the Human Genome Project provided the
  first drafts of nearly complete human genome sequences in 2001 after
  more than a decade of effort by scientists worldwide. This information
  is now being used to advance medicine, human biology, and knowledge of
  human origins.
</p>
<p class="lead">
  We foresee a day when many individuals will want to get their own genome
  sequenced so that they may use this information to understand such
  things as their individual risk profiles for disease, their physical
  and biological characteristics, and their personal ancestries. To get to
  this point will require a critical mass of interested users, tools for
  obtaining and interpreting genome information, and supportive policy,
  research, and service communities. To catalyze these developments, we
  launched the Personal Genome Project Canada (PGP-Canada).
