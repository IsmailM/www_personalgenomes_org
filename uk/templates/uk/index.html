<p>Dear PGP-UK volunteers,</p>

<p>We are devastated by the email problem, which was the result of human error, and sincerely apologise for it and any distress it may have caused.</p>

<p>We immediately responded to stop the problem spreading and will ensure that this does not happen again. We ask you for your patience and understanding while we investigate what went wrong.</p>

<p>Everyone who requested to be removed from PGP-UK will be removed and not receive any future announcements.</p>
 
<p>Once again, we apologise profusely to everyone affected and thank you for your continued support.</p>
 
<p>PGP-UK Team<br/>

The Personal Genome Project UK is dedicated to creating public UK genome, health, and trait data. Sharing data is critical to scientific progress, but has been hampered by traditional research practicesâ€”our approach is to invite willing participants to publicly share their personal data for the greater good.
